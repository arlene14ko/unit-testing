## About the Repository

This is a repository showing how to test a code using unittest and pytest.

### Repository

**README.md**
  - you are currently reading it right now

**program.py**
  - This contains the code that needs to be tested

**data folder**
  - this has 1 file namely:
      1. **test_data.json**
          - this contains the list of 20 test users used as a mock return value in the test
  
**tests folder**
  - this has 3 files namely:
      1. **conftest.py**
          - this is where the get_users fixture is stored so it can be accessed in any python file.

      2. **test_program_with_pytest.py**
          - this contains the tests using pytest, Mock object, fixture, parametrization, accessing conftest and other pytest features for all the functions in program.py

      3. **test_program_with_unittest.py**
          - this contains the tests using unittest, pytest, and Mock objects  for all the functions in program.py

  
## Clone/Fork Repository
  - If you wish to clone/fork this repository, you can just click on the repository, then click the Clone/fork button and follow the instructions.

## Pending...

 - I have two test files **test_program_with_unittest.py** and **test_program_with_pytest.py** because I am still figuring out how to do both in the same file.  So for now, I separate them and they are both working.
  
### Thank you for reading. Have fun!
